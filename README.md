The Chrome dino game is a simple infinite runner, in which you jump over cacti, and dodge upcoming obstacles.
This [Python Program](https://github.com/sgagankumar/Chrome-Dinosaur-Game-Hack/blob/master/Dinosaur%20Game%20Hack.py) is coded to auto play the dino game.
The program uses the position of the dinosaur on the screen to relatively scan for upcoming obstacles and correctly time the upcoming jumps.
